Upload your test-export video on YouTube/Vimeo and share the link here. I recommend uploading it as a private/password-secured video since it's only a test project for now.

Create your file on GitHub and include this for your file name:
## Firstname_Lastname_video.md

*What to do:*
Import multiple media files to timeline
Layer media files on the timeline
Separate the audio and video
Change the speed of video (slow motion/timelapse)
Add blending mode to top layer video
Video/audio transition for beginning and end
Export h264
