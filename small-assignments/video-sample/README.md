Upload your test-export video on YouTube/Vimeo and share the link here. I recommend uploading it as a private/password-secured video since it's only a test project for now.

Create your file on GitHub and include this for your file name:
## Firstname_Lastname_video.md

*What to do:* <br>
Import multiple media files to timeline<br>
Layer media files on the timeline<br>
Separate the audio and video<br>
Change the speed of video (slow motion/timelapse)<br>
Add blending mode to top layer video<br>
Video/audio transition for beginning and end<br>
Render in to out <br>
Export h264
