## Description 

For my First Digital Video Post Project, I record my daily life in San Jose. People have a lot of work and homework to do every single day, some people may feel happy to be busy but some may feel depressed due to stress. If people want to have a healthy life, they should have their own way to accept the depression and release. This is the way I lived and released my stress. I create the storyline and capture the scenes with my roommate in SJSU and HWY 9. ALso, it is the respect to Initial D, my favorite cartoon and moive.
