Description 

For my Digital Video Post Project, I originally wanted to do it on the comparison between chaotic places vs. peaceful places at San Jose State University. I ended up switiching it up a little but and decided to just do it on chaotic places around SJSU. This project could be shown pretty much anywhere. My influence for this reflectss how I see San Jose State University after attending here for almost two years. This video is suppose to open the viewers eyes on how they see San Jose State University.
