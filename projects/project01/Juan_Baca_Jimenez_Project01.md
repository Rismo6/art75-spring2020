### Trees are Vital

This video that I produced focuses on the amount of trees there is in the planet. Also the construction on buildings for our benefit. Since our population is growing, cutting down trees is also increasing. Which is hurting the environment with having less trees on Earth. This video provides some clips from an online source, www.pixabay.com, and some video clips recorded here in our neck of the woods. The whole idea for this video is just to bring the thought that we are cutting so many trees for our use, but we are not planting as much to balance it out from what were are cutting down.
