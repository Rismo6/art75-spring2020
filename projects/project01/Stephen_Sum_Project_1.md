5. Description:
My project gives the emotional feel of a normal day turning into a dream that every hard worker wants. A relaxation and escape from the reality that is controlling our everyday actions so that we can live. This video is about the perspective of the down view of a pair of legs walking in a single path while the environment changes all around them. As the journey sets forth, the setting changes into what seems to be more of a calming and beautiful. The reason I wanted to do this type of project was because I liked the concept where there is a single subject that is continuously going as the scenery changes around them. I want this piece to relate to the audience by having the same emotions and wants when they feel exhausted or very worn out. For this piece, I do not have a specific influence because I see these type of videos in like blogs and online social media.
