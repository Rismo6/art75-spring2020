**Description**
For this first project I wanted to explore how San Jose State has changed and evolved over time. The older parts of the school have started to degrade from years of use. The different buildings on campus hold different emotions and different generations within their halls. As the video progresses I want the viewer to feel a sense of deterioration as time goes on in the video. That they are starting to go crazy. I also want there to be a sense of repetition and a cyclic manner to how the video is arranged.
