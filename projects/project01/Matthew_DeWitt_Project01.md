3) Experimental Video

4) Dimensions: 1920 x 1080/ 3 minutes, 7 seconds

5) My project explores the realities of what being a student is. I tried to use the effects to enhance the feelings associated
with what my video is conveying. While being a student is a great opportunity and has a lot of benefits to it, there is also 
a certain negative aspect to it that most students experience. I want to highlight both sides of the story while 
displaying that both sides are necessary in growing as a person and getting closer to obtaining success. Given that we are 
all students attending the same school, Im sure that there are certain aspects to the video that everyone can relate to.
