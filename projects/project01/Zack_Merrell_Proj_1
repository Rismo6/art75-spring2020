### Description
This video is a visualization of the good and bad of Santa Cruz. It gives people the feeling of vacation and the relaxing ocean through the first three minutes and then ends with the other side of the beautiful nature by showing the homeless and pollution. I am hoping that this video will open the eyes of some of the people that don't live in Santa Cruz about what is going on. Maybe they can relate with their city as well and want to make a change in both their city and Santa Cruz. I am hoping that if you know nothing about Santa Cruz then you can get a representation of both the good and the bad.
