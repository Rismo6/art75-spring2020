5. The first half of the video consists of a monochrome color scheme whereas the second half introduces color to the audience. Overall, my personal motivation for the project stems from my friend, who constantly buys clothes online but never wears them. She always has an excuse to not wear her new clothes, opting to wear the same things she has worn for years on end. This is due mainly in part to her lack of confidence and how she does not think she can pair items well. Thus, this video is dedicated to her to show her that she should not be afraid to wear what she likes.
