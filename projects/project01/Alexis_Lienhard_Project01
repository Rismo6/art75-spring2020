My video is about a sister telling a story about her sister’s suicide. It will help the viewer almost understand what they read in the essay, but also have a chance to contemplate and question their own theories as well. My essay would be seen as a black and white film with little to no narration, other than subtitles. Visually there would be diffrent clips, and pictures of a girl acting out here suicide. It would be seen like it’s been filmed or a camera that is filming it. I would only use background music, probably from a Tim Burton soundtrack or Danny Elfman type sounds and feels. There will be a little to no transitions at all because I want this to feel like someone’s life/death documented instead of just a cheesy childish video. I would have it portrayed in a more abstract way by creating a 1960’s theater-like feel to a gallery. Having the video playing through a projector and two curtains on the side to open up and present the film. It would be a fully dark light with very little light just to get to your seats. Because this is a silent black and white film, I want it to have an older feel, so it can seem almost ancient while having a serious modern-day vibe to it as well.
