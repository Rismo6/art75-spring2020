2. Experimental video
3. Duration - 3:39 minutes
4. This is video is expressing what it feels to have depression always in your face. With errie music playing throughout the walk of the first person to understand what they are feeling and seeing. I wanted to show this to bring awareness of what it feels to have this ghost always in front of you never leaving from what it feel like to me.I am influenced by what I feel and wanted to show it not lurking behind you, but it is always in front of you, but you must ignore it to not let it convience you. The artist that influenced this was Bill Viola and the way they use shilouettes and use of real time actions.
