#Description
  My idea comes out of the paper airplane toward the meaning of the missing parents.
The main character is the paper plane which flies to parents from me. And the airplane fold
by the letter which I want to say to my family. However, today people donâ€™t kind of using
that traditional medium to deliver the info to others. So the turning point will be the airplane
could not arrive on my family and fall down somewhere, but soon I take out my phone to
message them at the moment. It seems that a humorous way that the comparison between the
old tradition and the new era.
