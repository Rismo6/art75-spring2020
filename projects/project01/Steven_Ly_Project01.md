### Description

  In my video project, I decided to display a way of what I daydream about during class and how it really looks like during
  reality. The main purpose of this video is to tell the audience that I miss summer and I want to do all sorts of travelling
  once the season comes back around. To me, the video I produced should look as a mixture of what we can expect in the day to
  day life at SJSU, but then once day dreaming kicks in, the video should feel vibrant and the music along with it should make
  it feel very tropical. The product can be viewed anywhere, to my belief, and give you a "relatable" feeling if you're missing
  the season of summer. And as for my influences for this type of video, I would have to say the GoPro Youtube channel gave me
  a ton of inspiration for traveling and aspects of the world I have never seen before.
