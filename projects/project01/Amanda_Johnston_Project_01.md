**Description**


My project is a visual juxtaposition of chaotic human activity and the serenity of nature. The intention is to have the viewer see the contrast and tension between the two experiences and hopefully encourage them to engage in experiences in nature to balance out the chaos found in daily living. The audio experience reflects the same tension. I have created unity throughout the video by using repeated video clips of artificial heart cells called Cardiomyocytes which are grown in a laboratory and beat on their own. I am sharing the video on Vimeo and hopefully it will be projected in an installation in a gallery. Ideally; however, it would be mapped onto a building, showing it in an urban environment is the perfect venue.
