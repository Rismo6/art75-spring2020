5. My project is a representation of the progression of a basketball player from zero. It starts with basic dribbling
and shooting drills adn eventually more challenging drills. I recently rediscovered my passion for basketball so this video
is also hinting at me coming back to basketball. The video then ends with live game clips showing a combination of the things
being practiced beforehand. This video is meant to encourage people that want to start playing and help them have a basic 
start to becoming a better basketball player.
